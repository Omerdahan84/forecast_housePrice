# Polynomial Fitting, City Temperature Prediction, and House Price Prediction

## Overview
The main details are in the Answers file and include plots and explainations. 
This repository contains three projects focused on regression models for different tasks:

1. **Polynomial Fitting** (`polynomial_fitting.py`): Fits polynomial regression using least squares.
2. **City Temperature Prediction** (`city_temperature_prediction.py`): Predicts daily temperatures using polynomial regression.
3. **House Price Prediction** (`house_price_prediction.py`): Predicts house prices with linear regression.

## Files

### 1. Polynomial Fitting (`polynomial_fitting.py`)
- Implements polynomial regression.
- Methods: `fit()`, `predict()`, `loss()` for model training, prediction, and error evaluation.

### 2. City Temperature Prediction (`city_temperature_prediction.py`)
- Uses polynomial regression to predict daily temperatures.
- Features country filtering and data visualization.

### 3. House Price Prediction (`house_price_prediction.py`)
- Predicts house prices with preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression.
- Includes feature evaluation and confidence intervals for model performance.
### 4. linear regression.py
- This class implemented basic linear regrssion base on MSE, we solve the MSE using moore penrose inverse.
